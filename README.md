# Assignment Portfolio Website (GitHub Pages)

This site is a **privacy-safe** portfolio (no last name, phone, email, or photos by default).

## File structure
- `index.html` — About
- `resume.html` — Resume rendered natively in HTML
- `projects/` — Project pages
- `assets/style.css` — Shared styles
- `assets/img/` — Placeholder graphics (replace with your own screenshots)

## Customize
1. Optional links: search for `add your link` and replace with your GitHub/LinkedIn.
2. Replace placeholder images in `assets/img/` with screenshots you own.
3. Update project content in `projects/*.html`.

## Host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo on GitHub named `portfolio` (any name is fine).
2. Upload these files to the **root** of the repo.
3. In GitHub:
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
4. Save. Your site will appear at a URL like:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio/`

If you name the repo `<your-username>.github.io`, GitHub will host it at:
- `https://<your-username>.github.io/`
